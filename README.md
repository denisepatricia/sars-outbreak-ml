# SARS 2003 Outbreak Machine Learning


Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a variety of illnesses, ranging from the common cold to more serious infections like those caused by the Coronavirus associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). However, we have recently been exposed to a novel coronavirus. The majority of us are unsure if COVID-19 and SARS-Cov are the same virus. No, that is not the case. Both the COVID-19 virus and the SARS-CoV are coronaviruses that are genetically related, but they are not the same. SARS is more lethal and deadly than COVID-19, but it is less contagious.
<p>
    Furthermore, we want to implement a regression problem involving the distribution of confirmed cases versus the death figure. We want to see if the theories about SARS being more lethal and deadly than COVID-19 are correct.
